On August 2024, i decided to start the journey of OS development.

> *Why?*

I wanted to experience something new since i was getting bored of Python development, and also wanted to learn C.

Obviously, i won't be able to talk about everything in this post. There will be more and more updates coming as the project goes on (which you can check out [here](https://github.com/RepubblicaTech/rtos))

## a. Introduction

The first thing you've got to remember, if you want to start doing OS development, is this:

### [The OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page)

This is probably one of the many tabs that you'll have to keep open for a very long time: it's the most fundamental reference for OS-related programming.

Obviously, this isn't the only place that you will check out: You may want to take a look to blogs, forums, YouTube Channels, etc. for some more information.

Here are some resources you can check out:

- [BrokenThorn's OS Development Series](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html)
- [Intel Software Development Manual (direct download link)](https://cdrdv2-public.intel.com/835758/325384-sdm-vol-3abcd.pdf)
- [Intel Assembly Manual](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1273844/The-Intel-Assembly-Manual-3)
- [dreamportdev's OSDev notes](https://github.com/dreamportdev/Osdev-Notes) + [PDF download link](https://github.com/dreamportdev/Osdev-Notes/releases/tag/latest-master)
- [Nanobyte's Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/@nanobyte-dev)
- [Olivestem's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@olivestemlearning)

## b. Getting Started

I won't get into the details of how to get an OS development environment set up, since it's already well documented in the OSDev wiki.

An important thing to note is the goal of the development of your own OS: having somewhat of a roadmap and a list of "cool stuff to do" (eg. porting GNU utilities (bash, ls, ...), having a GUI, compiling your OS from inside your OS, etc.) will come back in handy.

## c. "Hello World!"

If you've followed [this tutorial](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) on the wiki, you have just created a simple 32-bit kernel that prints stuff to the screen. The article might give you some advice on how to continue (adding newline support, terminal scrolling, etc.), which i'd highly suggest to do.

If you've decided instead to use a 64-bit kernel and followed this guide, you pretty much have to implement everything from scratch, since it only gets to the point to give you a 1280x800 framebuffer to draw stuff in.

Anyways, after that, you've first got to think about the structure of your code: knowing where that `gdt.c` or `io.asm` file is in your project will be useful when your code will start to look something like this:

## d. What now?

You might have just finished implementing some sort of `printf()` in your kernel. Well, that's just the start of a long journey.

A lot of stuff needs to be done in your kernel before having a command prompt, a GUI or whatever you have planned.
You've a bit of technical things to implement before going on, and this is a list that i have got for now:

- Kernel debugging (firstly with GDB. This is optional, but it will help you a lot when troubleshooting errors and faults)
- Segmentation (GDT)
- Interrupt handling (IDT, ISRs, IRQs)
- PIC IRQs (timer, keyboard, etc.)
- More kernel debugging (this time using debuggers like VSCode's to view all variable contents)
- Memory mapping/management
- File system support
- Ring 3 (userspace)

I'll try to explain these steps in the future posts as i'll advance in my OSDev experience.

Next post about this series will talk about all of the steps from the `printf()` implementation to the PIC IRQs in a very generic way since they are a must for any OS, and you can easily implement these in your OS after checking the OSDev Wiki and some YouTube videos.

Well, that's enough for today, i hope you learned something new. See you next time!
